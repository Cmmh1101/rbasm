                Jeanna' is the owner of Rockwall Body and Soul Massage with over
                16 years of experience. She's the "Jeanna' of all trades"
                therapist that combines the many modalities she's learned during
                each session. Jeanna' is an Ashiatsu therapist, which means she
                uses her feet to massage as well as her hands, and a Thai
                massage practitioner, which is a form of bodywork done on a mat.
              </p>
              <p>
                She also specializes in PTSD massage therapy with a deep
                understanding of the way the body keeps the score. She loves
                every aspect of massage and bodywork, creating the warm ambience
                and getting to know each client as she works on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jeanna' is also a writer and poet,a fitness addict, a lover of
                trees, nature, music and dance. Her Bohemian Cowgirl room is
                filled with original art, bright colors and the intoxicating
                scents of coconut oil, jasmine and cinnamon. Jeanna' listens
                intentionally because she has a profound hearing loss... which
                means she reads lips, sits close and gives her complete
                attention when she's with anyone.

              <p class="">
                Laura Bejeles came to Rockwall Body and Soul Massage in May of
                2017 and started her internship... five months later, she aced
                her MBLEX and began making waves! Laura is our "Pampering Queen"
                with an amazing intuitive touch, a gentle spirit, and vast
                understanding of anatomy and spirituality. She combines Swedish
                massage with deep tissue techniques in such a way that almost
                every client falls asleep during their sessions.
              </p>
              <p>
                She loves doing the Simple Man, Cowgirl Blues and other sessions
                that include hot stones, warm towels, facials and scrubs. She's
                the one to choose if you are wanting deep relaxation and
                pampering while still receiving the therapeutic benefits of a
                custom massage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the lavish for ladies service is only offered by
                Laura Bjeles. It's a luxurious lavender massage with 5 step
                facial.
              </p>
              <p>
                Laura is also absolutely amazing at prenatal massage and sees
                many women from the beginning of their pregnancy until after
                when she offers postpartum sessions to help recovery.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Laura isn't up here, she's out in the country enjoying the
                sunsets, listening to music, and taking gorgeous pictures.

                Laura is fluent in America Sign Language and has a cochlear
